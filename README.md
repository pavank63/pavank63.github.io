# Pavan Kalyan Reddy Cherupally

I’m Pavan Kalyan Reddy Cherupally, a software engineer with a keen interest in distributed systems, high-performance computing, and cloud-native technologies. Currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science at Arizona State University, I’m deepening my expertise in scalable architectures, automation frameworks, and large-scale data processing. At AMD, I’m working on developing a React-based framework to automate benchmarking for HPC systems, integrating performance visualization and workload management for remote Linux systems.

Previously, at BrowserStack, I focused on infrastructure modernization by transitioning monolithic services to Kubernetes-based microservices and building internal platforms for cost governance and real-time monitoring. I also worked extensively on centralized logging systems, data pipelines with Apache Airflow, and integrating cross-platform compatibility for BrowserStack’s testing platform. My research experience at IIIT Hyderabad involved building machine learning models for predictive analysis in VLSI design and exploring AI applications in hardware systems. I am driven by a passion for designing scalable systems and solving challenging engineering problems at the intersection of software and hardware.
