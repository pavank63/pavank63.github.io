# Pavan Kalyan Reddy Cherupally

I'm Pavan Kalyan Reddy Cherupally, a software engineer with a solid foundation in computer science and electronics engineering. Currently, I am pursuing my Masterâ€™s in Computer Science at Arizona State University, where I am delving deeper into distributed systems, cloud computing, and data processing at scale. Over the years, I have built strong programming skills in languages like C++, Python, and Java, along with expertise in frameworks such as Django, Flask, and Kubernetes. My academic and hands-on experiences have allowed me to design scalable systems, optimize workflows, and contribute to impactful projects, blending theory with real-world applications.

I am currently interning at AMD as a Software Intern, contributing to optimizing performance and creating automated solutions for high-performance computing systems. Previously, at BrowserStack, I led initiatives to enhance system performance, transition monolithic systems to Kubernetes-based microservices, and implement feature flagging for seamless releases. These efforts significantly improved scalability and reduced infrastructure costs. As a Research Assistant at IIIT Hyderabad, I built machine learning models for predictive analysis in VLSI design and co-authored research papers on AI/ML applications in hardware systems. Across my journey, I have been driven by a passion for innovation and creating technological solutions that make a difference.
